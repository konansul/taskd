This is a test document for FastAPI presentation generation.

We expect six slides to be created from this text.

Key points:
- FastAPI handles file uploads
- Python extracts text from DOCX
- Gemini generates slide outlines
- python-pptx builds the final file

Conclusion: the pipeline works end-to-end.
